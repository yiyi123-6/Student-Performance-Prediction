# Student Performance Prediction
Background: Many online education platforms include an assessment componentto ensure that students understand the core topics. The assessment component is often composed of diagnostic questions, each a multiple choice question with one correct answer. In this project, we built machine learning algorithms to predict whether a student can correctly answer a specific diagnostic question based on the student's previous answers to some other questions. Predicting the correctness of students' answers to as yet unseen diagnostic questions helps estimate the student's ability level in a personalized education platform. 
Data: subsampled answers of 542 students to 1774 diagnostic questions from the dataset provided by Eedi2, an online education platform that is currently being used in many schools.
